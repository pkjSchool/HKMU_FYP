## Background

&emsp; The COVID-19 pandemic and advances in digital technology have transformed music education, leading to the use of learning videos, apps, and online courses. However, many children struggle to stay motivated and often give up on learning music. Research indicates that a lack of choice in repertoire and parental interference negatively impacts studentsâ€™ engagement. In reviewing traditional and online piano platforms, we identified key issues such as insufficient engagement, ineffective practice routines, and a lack of personalized learning experiences. To address these challenges, we propose a web application that combines gamification with real-time interaction through MIDI pianos. This innovative platform aims to make learning music theory and piano techniques more appealing, enhancing student motivation. By utilizing AI to customize music styles and offering a game-like experience, our application seeks to inspire users and improve their overall musical skills. Targeted at beginner pianists, it will teach essential skills such as reading sheet music, fingering, and rhythm. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the musical culture of Hong Kong by raising music accomplishment and appreciation among users, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable learning environment.
